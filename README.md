# Chai Culture - "Brew the Royal Tradition"

This is a premium "Coming Soon" landing page for **Chai Culture**, designed to capture the elegance and heritage of royal Indian traditions while building a waiting list for the upcoming product launch.

## Design Choices
To reflect the "Royal Tradition" brand identity, I selected a sophisticated color palette anchored in **Deep Royal Brown** (`#1a120b`) and **Metallic Gold** (`#d4af37`). 

*   **Typography:** *Cinzel* was chosen for headers to evoke a majestic, statue-esque quality, while *Playfair Display* adds editorial elegance to the body text.
*   **Visuals:** Subtle mandala corner ornaments frame the viewport like a royal invitation, and a delicate grain texture overlay provides a tactile, premium feel.
*   **UX:** The email form utilizes glassmorphism to blend modern digital aesthetics with the traditional background, ensuring the call-to-action stands out without breaking immersion.

## Features
*   **Responsive Design:** Fluid layout that adapts gracefully from mobile screens to 4K desktops.
*   **Interactive Feedback:** Button loading states and success messages for the email signup.
*   **Animations:** Gentle fade-ins and hover effects to create a sense of luxury and polish.

## Tech Stack
*   **React:** Component-based architecture for maintainability.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first styling with a custom configuration for the specific color palette and fonts.
*   **Lucide Icons:** Lightweight, crisp SVG icons.
